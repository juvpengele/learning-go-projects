# 🚀 Go Language Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal learning tracker for mastering the **Go programming language (Golang)**.  
This repository will contain hands-on projects ranging from beginner to advanced level.

I’m starting from the basics and progressively building my way up through real-world applications.

## 📘 Current Status

✅ **Currently working on:** `Calculator CLI`

🛠️ **Learning Goals:**
- Understand the basics of Go syntax
- Learn how to work with user input and command-line interfaces
- Handle basic operations using functions and conditionals
